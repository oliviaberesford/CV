Having come from an artistic background I have always been interested in ways of combining technology and creativity. After trying multiple job roles within the creative industry I trained and worked as a visual effects artist which opened up much more curiosity for exploring other avenues in the world of technology. It fuelled me to want to create and develop ideas of my own which I was very keen to learn how to do myself. I therefore attended Makers Academy eager to develop such skills to enable me to have the ability to create new and exciting things from scratch as a software developer and take me down a new career path.
